# Below script will download the UCI HAR Dataset from 
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
# the script does the following steps to get a tidy data set
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
