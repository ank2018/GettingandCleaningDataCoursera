## R Markdown CodeBook Description

CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data Project. This Codebook describes the variables, the data and any work performed to cleanup the data.

## Source Information
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body
* acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

The R script run_analysis.R does the following. 
1.	On Windows machine, downloads the zip file in a project working directory:  courseprojecttidydata/getdatafiles.zip
2.	Unzips the zip file to UCI HAR Dataset. 
3.	Reads the data files (features.txt, activity_labels.txt, subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt) 
4.	Add columns names to each of these files.
5.	Using cbind merges the files subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt.
6.	Reads the data files (subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt) 
7.	Add columns names to each of these files.
8.	Using cbind merges the files subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt).
9.	Using rbind merges the training and the test data sets to create one master data set.
10.	Using grepl extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
11.	Merges to uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set via data read from activity_labels.txt.
12.	Using gsub appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Remove unwanted characters/strings from the variable names and provide more readable names.
13.	From the data set in above step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
14.	Writes the final tidy data to a file - Coursefinaltidydata.csv in two directories above the current data set directory.
It also prints messages to show the progress made during the script execution.
